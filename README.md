# Conductor
Pedagogy Tool for Musical Conducting

Traditionally, the only way for a student to learn and improve upon conducting skills is to perform in front of an instructor to receive physical and verbal instruction. Video recording has helped some with this process, but the time and attention of the instructor is still necessary. This research seeks to determine whether it is possible to develop an automated system that can "see" a student and provide feedback based on his/her movements. 

Requires Leap Motion SDK to compile, and Leap Motion hardware to operate.
